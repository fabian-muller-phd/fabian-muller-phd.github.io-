    <div class="section-text">
      <p>I take a flexible, problem-driven approach: I start with the question and choose, or learn, the methods that will answer it best. My work draws on national administrative education data, international assessments, and preregistered experiments.</p>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>What I work with</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Administrative education data (French Ministry of Education, DEPP)</li>
        <li>International assessments such as PISA</li>
        <li>Multi-university surveys</li>
        <li>Preregistered experiments with students and teachers</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>How I analyze</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Randomized behavioral experiments</li>
        <li>Quasi-experimental designs (e.g., difference-in-differences)</li>
        <li>Longitudinal growth and multilevel models</li>
        <li>Structural equation modeling (SEM)</li>
        <li>Systematic literature reviews</li>
        <li>All analyses in R with fully reproducible pipelines</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>Open science</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Preregistration</li>
        <li>Sharing materials, code, and, where possible, data</li>
        <li>Transparent reporting so results can be scrutinized, replicated, and applied</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="why-it-matters"><strong>Why it matters.</strong> For me, methods are not an end in themselves. They’re tools to solve real problems in education and inequality, so policy can rely on evidence rather than assumptions.</p>

<div class="research-section" id="social-class">
  <h2>Social Class</h2>

  <div class="section-body">
    <figure class="section-media">
      <img src="/assets/images/Alex_first_gen.jpg" alt="First-generation student navigating university" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
      <figcaption>Caption placeholder</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div class="section-text">
      <p>I study how social class shapes students’ paths through school and university.</p>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>Key findings</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li><a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04163355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Work</a> across France and Germany shows success isn’t only about ability; it’s also about fit with the unwritten rules of academic life.</li>
        <li>Working-class students often bring a strong “we” orientation (family, community, mutual support) into settings that reward “I” (self-promotion, individual initiative). Some high-achieving working-class students adjust how they present themselves at home and at university, yet feeling “in place” can still lag behind similar grades.</li>
        <li>COVID-19 pushed learning online and raised the need for independence and stable internet. That made the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/irsp.716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fit gap costlier</a> for working-class students, who participated less and more often considered dropping out.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>Current work</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>With administrative data from the Directorate of Evaluation, Forecasting and Performance (DEPP) at the French Ministry of National Education and Youth, I model learning trajectories in primary school across multiple years and cohorts with different levels of COVID disruption to see when gaps open or close and for whom.</li>
        <li>This goes beyond averages to identify profiles of resilience and risk by socioeconomic background and gender.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="why-it-matters"><strong>Why it matters.</strong> If we understand how and when inequalities grow, we can design supports that respect different ways of being (not just one “right” student profile), make classroom and admissions practices more inclusive, and target recovery resources where they help most.</p>

  <h2>SEN (Special Educational Needs)</h2>

  <div class="section-body">

      <img src="/assets/images/Math_test.jpg" alt="Student taking a math test" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
      <figcaption>Caption placeholder</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div class="section-text">
      <p>I study when exam accommodations actually level the playing field, and how teachers’ perceptions shape grading and competence judgments.</p>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>Key findings</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Identical work was graded lower when SEN status was disclosed, <a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fx7jc_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unless teachers viewed the accommodation as fair</a>.</li>
        <li>Not all accommodations are viewed equally: extra time and computer use are judged more fair and comparable; oral assistance or exemptions are seen <a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/fcnz4_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as less comparable</a>.</li>
        <li>The gap between “this feels fair” and “this is equivalent” reflects a persistent worry about maintaining ranking.</li>
        <li>Takeaway: fairness-focused teacher training can reduce bias and support genuinely inclusive assessment.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>How I study it</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Preregistered, multi-study designs with teachers and school leaders in France, using realistic grading tasks and clear analysis plans.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="why-it-matters"><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Accommodations advance equity only when they work in practice and are seen as legitimate. By clarifying their purpose, aligning them with assessment criteria, and communicating this clearly to educators, schools can make support work as intended, ensuring fairness without undermining trust in results.</p>

  <h2>Assessment</h2>

    <div class="section-text">
      <p>I work on measures that policy can trust.</p>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>Key findings</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2019.100304" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systematic review</a> of ~14,000 records mapped ~<a href="https://2017-20.handinhand.si/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SEI-measures_CATALOGUE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">150 tools</a> for social, emotional, and intercultural competencies and showed where current measures work, where they don’t, and why intercultural skills need much stronger coverage.</li>
        <li>Inclusion in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-27608-9_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large-scale assessments</a> improves when we separate testability from SEN status and strengthen sampling and task design.</li>
        <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.15675.98087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eye-tracking</a> in Taiwan and Germany shows response processes differ and shift under social-desirability pressure, limiting cross-country comparisons based on self-reports.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>How I study it</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Systematic reviews and tool mapping</li>
        <li>Design guidance for inclusion in large-scale assessments</li>
        <li>Response-process work with eye-tracking in cross-cultural samples</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="why-it-matters"><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Policy and practice need measures that are valid, culturally responsive, and seen as legitimate by educators. Triangulating methods beyond surveys and designing inclusive assessments make the data strong enough to guide real decisions about teaching, resources, and equity.</p>

  <h2>LGBTIQ+</h2>

  <div class="section-body">
    <figure class="section-media">
      <img src="/assets/images/PAW.jpg" alt="PROUT AT WORK – workplace inclusion" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
      <figcaption>Caption placeholder</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div class="section-text">
      <p>I study what makes inclusion real: how language, policies, and everyday practices shape whether LGBTIQ+ people can be open at work and thrive.</p>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>Outputs</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Employer guides for PROUT AT WORK: <a href="https://www.proutatwork.de/produkt/how-to-3-sprechen-sie-lgbtiq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gender-inclusive language</a>, <a href="https://www.proutatwork.de/produkt/how-to-4-lgbtiq-fuer-einsteigerinnen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting started with LGBTIQ+ at work</a>, <a href="https://www.proutatwork.de/produkt/how-to-5-queere-themen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming-out support</a>.</li>
        <li>Each translates research into concrete steps (e.g., inclusive job ads, benefits parity, clear reporting channels).</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>Mechanism</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Language and policy signal who belongs. Inclusive wording changes what people picture, broadens who applies, and supports performance and commitment across contexts.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="list-label"><strong>Role</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>I served for several years as the international representative of the German professional association <a href="https://www.vlsp.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VLSP*</a> in <a href="https://www.apa.org/ipsynet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPsyNet</a> (APA’s international LGBTIQ+ psychology network), connecting national groups and contributing to international policy statements.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="why-it-matters"><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Concealment is costly: when people have to hide who they are, health, focus, and productivity suffer. When workplaces make inclusion explicit and credible, satisfaction, retention, and performance improve. The payoff is human and organizational, and it starts with clear, evidence-based practices.</p>
